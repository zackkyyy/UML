Changes in the model after the review 1- Removed the authentications as it should not be included in a model but in a software architect2- In the first submission, I used navigation arrows which I got to know from the reviews later that they are not really preferred to be used. Moreover, in the final submission I did not used arrows, but I used just linking lines between the classes 3-  In the first submission, I had some methods written in the model (AddEvent, uppdateEvent….) while in the final submission I deleted them for the same reason in the first point. I should have thought as a plan maker where my model should not be mixed with software architecture.
